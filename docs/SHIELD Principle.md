# SHIELD: Separate Human Identities Entirely from Linked Data

## Core Definition
SHIELD represents the impenetrable barrier maintained between participant identities and any data collected or processed within the ImpowerSurvey system.

## Key Aspects:
1. Separate: Keep distinct and apart at all times.
2. Human: Emphasize the protection of individual participants.
3. Identities: Any information that could identify a person.
4. Entirely: Completely and without exception.
5. from: Emphasize the division between identity and data.
6. Linked: Any associated or connected information.
7. Data: Survey responses, participation status, or any other collected information.

## Practical Applications in ImpowerSurvey:

1. Database Design:
   - Implement strict data partitioning.
   - Ensure no shared keys or identifiers between identity and response databases.

2. Authentication and Participation Tracking:
   - Use anonymized tokens for survey access and progress tracking.
   - Implement a double-blind system where one service handles authentication and another handles responses.

3. Data Transmission:
   - Encrypt all data in transit (HTTPS).

4. Data Analysis:
   - Implement differential privacy techniques for data aggregation and analysis.
   - Use secure multi-party computation for operations that might require linking data.

5. User Interface:
   - Design the UI to visually reinforce the separation of identity and survey data.
   - Use clear messaging to inform users about the SHIELD principle.

6. Code Reviews and Development:
   - Include SHIELD compliance as a mandatory checkpoint in code reviews.
   - Develop unit tests specifically to verify SHIELD principle adherence.

7. Third-party Integrations:
   - Scrutinize any third-party services or libraries to ensure they don't compromise the SHIELD.
   - Implement additional abstraction layers if necessary to maintain separation.

8. Auditing and Logging:
   - Implement robust logging that captures system operations without linking to individual identities.
   - Conduct regular audits to ensure the SHIELD remains intact across all system components.

9. Data Retention and Deletion:
   - Implement separate retention policies for identity data and survey data.
   - Ensure complete and verifiable deletion processes that maintain the SHIELD even during data removal.

10. Documentation and Training:
    - Include SHIELD principle explanation in all relevant documentation.
    - Conduct regular training sessions for team members on the importance and implementation of SHIELD.

## Decision-Making Guide:
When considering new features or changes to the ImpowerSurvey system, always ask:
- Does this maintain the SHIELD between identities and data?
- Is there any way this could be used to breach the SHIELD?
- How can we implement this feature while reinforcing the SHIELD?

Remember: The SHIELD should be impenetrable. No feature, process, or external pressure should be allowed to breach the separation between identities and linked data in the ImpowerSurvey system.
